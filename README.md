# odin-rock-paper-scissors-project

This Rock, Paper, Scissors Project follows along with Odins Project.

This is a javascript based project, made to work with htmls promts.
This was a learning curve to working with javascript, creating functions and calling them, creating loops, and sets of if/else statements. It also was my first experience with math methods. 

The only personal touch I added was a round counter in the playGame function.
